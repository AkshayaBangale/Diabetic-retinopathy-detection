# Diabetic-retinopathy-detection
Abstract— Detecting diabetic retinopathy (DR) early is important to prevent permanent vision loss in people with diabetes. Current methods to find DR can be slow and inaccurate, so there’s a need for better, automated approaches. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown in analyzing medical images, especially for spotting DR. In this study, we suggest a new method that combines CNNs for feature extraction with Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) for processing image sequences. By using CNN to capture important image details and LSTM to analyze patterns over time. The goal is to improve the accuracy and speed of  diagnosis, making it easier for healthcare providers to treat patients before the condition worsens and improving diabetes care globally . 

INTRODUCTION:  
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a serious eye condition caused by diabetes, damaging the blood vessels of retina leading to vision loss.
Early detection of DR is crucial but challenging, as it requires detailed analysis of fundus images.
Right now, ophthalmologists manually examine the fundus images to diagnose  Diabetic Retinopathy (DR).
With the increasing number of  diabetes cases worldwide, there’s a  need for faster and more reliable methods to treat Diabetic Retinopathy(DR).
Deep learning techniques helps in learning and extraction of features from image datasets.
By using these deep learning techniques, we can speed up the diagnosis process which potentially increases the quality of the treatment.
This project explores how deep learning methods can be  used to classify fundus images which benefits both doctor to interpret easily like how decision has been taken by model.
